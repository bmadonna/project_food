                <p><b>Healthy Choice.......</b></p>
                <p><b>Here is the good news! Flaxseed the new wonder food! Some call it one of the most powerful plant foods on the planet. There’s some evidence; it helps reduce your risk of heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes. That’s quite a tall order for a tiny seed that’s been around for centuries.
                 Flaxseed (otherwise called linseed) is a wonder ingredient for vegans and non-vegans alike. Flaxseed works amazingly as a gluten-free vegan egg replacement, is packed with nutrition and a perfect healthy addition to smoothies, porridge, etc. In just one tablespoon of flaxseed, they are good sources of protein, carbs, and fiber. These work together to improve gut health and digestion, as well as having a positive effect on blood sugar levels and cholesterol</b></p>
