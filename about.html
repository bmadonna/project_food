                    <p>Hello! I am B Madonna, a Public Health Specialist and ‘a Naturalist’. In my year of experience, I have studied heart diseases, stroke, diabetes and cancer as the leading cause of death. As frightening as those statistics are the risks of getting those diseases are even higher among Nigerians. Here you will find creative healthy trustworthy recipes that encompass my love for organic foods and my passion for making everything from scratch.</p>
                    <p class="dark">Here is the good news! Flaxseed the new wonder food! Some call it one of the most powerful plant foods on the planet. There’s some evidence; it helps reduce your risk of heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes. That’s quite a tall order for a tiny seed that’s been around for centuries.
Flaxseed (otherwise called linseed) is a wonder ingredient for vegans and non-vegans alike. Flaxseed works amazingly as a gluten-free vegan egg replacement, is packed with nutrition and a perfect healthy addition to smoothies, porridge, etc. In just one tablespoon of flaxseed, they are good sources of protein, carbs, and fiber. These work together to improve gut health and digestion, as well as having a positive effect on blood sugar levels and cholesterolThe seeds are also full of  ALA omega-3 fatty acids as well as a variety of vitamins and minerals, including Vitamin B1, Magnesium, Phosphorus. ALA is shown to improve heart health, reducing the risk of a heart attack, a stroke and cholesterol levels. 
Flax seeds are also a rich source of Lignans, which not only has certain estrogen properties but also contain anti-cancerous features too. This is particularly noted with specific types of cancer, such as breast and prostate and colon cancer.</p>

                    <h3> The Benefits of Flaxseed</h3>
                    <p>Although flaxseed contains all sorts of healthy components, it owes its primary healthy reputation to three of them:
•	Omega-3 essential fatty acids, "good" fats that have been shown to have heart-healthy effects.
•	Lignans, which have both plant estrogen and antioxidant qualities. Flaxseed contains 75 to 800 times more lignans than other plant foods.
•	Fiber. Flaxseed contains both the soluble and insoluble types.
Now, recent studies have suggested that consumption of flaxseed have a protective effect against breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colon cancer. The plant omega-3 fatty acid found in flaxseed, called ALA, inhibited tumor incidence and growth.</p>
