                                    <p>1 glass cup per serving. Flaxseed milk is arguably better for the environment than other dairy-free milk options, such as almond milk. As it takes a fraction of the water needed by certain nuts (and obviously dairy as well), to grow the plant. In just one tablespoon of flaxseed, they are good sources of protein, carbs, and fiber.
The seeds are also full of omega-3 fatty acids as well as a variety of vitamins and minerals, including Vitamin B1, Magnesium, Phosphorus, and more.
The high level of fiber is good for us in several ways. Flax seeds are high in fiber with two types of fiber – soluble and insoluble fiber. These work together to improve gut health and digestion, as well as having a positive effect on blood sugar levels and cholesterol.</p>
